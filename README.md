Mod for Worldbox

[Requires NeoModLoader](https://github.com/WorldBoxOpenMods/ModLoader)

# [This mod is available on GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/499173)

This mod allows new cultures to be created when a rebellion occurs. The new culture will encompass all of the rebellion's cities.

The odds of this happening are configurable within NeoModLoader. There are 6 settings:
  * Culture By Capital: Whether or not new cultures are allowed to be spawned next to the original kingdom's capital.
  * Same Continent Chance: The probability (0-1) that a new culture will be created when a rebellion happens on the same continent as the kingdom's capital.
  * Different Continent Chance: The probability (0-1) that a new culture will be created when a rebellion happens on a different continent from the kingdom's capital.
  * Remove Culture: Whether a small culture can be removed by a new culture being created.
  * Must Match Kingdom: Whether the culture of the rebelling city has to match the culture of the kingdom it's rebelling from.
  * Natural Tile Swapping: If enabled, limits swapping tiles between cultures unless one culture has more than 2/3 of the units in a chunk.


The only hard restriction on new culture creation is the rebellion's city count has to be less than the original kingdom's
  * The rebelling country's capital has to have the same culture as its old kingdom.
